### A few of my (current) favorite things
I have few lifetime favorites, but I always have a lot of recent favorites. Here are some:

- book: [To the Lighthouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_the_Lighthouse) (Virginia Woolf had an amazing understanding of the diversity of human perspective)

- song: [thank u, next](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl1aHhXnN1k) (I love Ari)

- movie: [Suspiria (2018)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1034415/) (kidding, couldn't even watch the whole thing)

- exercise: [Bulgarian Split Squat](https://www.muscleforlife.com/bulgarian-split-squat/) (great for someone like me who has underdeveloped hamstrings)

### Popular Annabelles
While my name has seen a [rise in popularity](https://www.behindthename.com/name/annabelle/top) in recent years, it isn't exactly a 'John Smith' of English language names. For reference, a few popular Annabelles in media are:

1. [the cow](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133372/)
2. [the doll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annabelle_(film))
3. [the poem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annabel_Lee) (and my namesake)
