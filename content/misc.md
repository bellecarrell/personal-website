### A few of my (current) favorite things
I have few lifetime favorites, but I always have a lot of recent favorites. Here are some:

- book: [To the Lighthouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_the_Lighthouse) (Virginia Woolf had an amazing understanding of the diversity of human perspective)

- song: [929](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLw90Ofj5mw) (Badlands is still my favorite Halsey album, though.)

- TV show: [Search Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_Party_(TV_series) ) (It lined up well with my own restlessness at the time of watching.)

- exercise: [Bulgarian Split Squat](https://www.muscleforlife.com/bulgarian-split-squat/) (It's a great exercise for people with underdeveloped hamstrings, like me.)

### Popular Annabelles
While my name has seen a [rise in popularity](https://www.behindthename.com/name/annabelle/top) in recent years, it isn't exactly a 'John Smith' of English language names. For reference, a few popular Annabelles in media are:

1. [the cow](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133372/)
2. [the doll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annabelle_(film))
3. [the poem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annabel_Lee) (and my namesake)
