I'm a PhD student at the University of Cambridge, advised by [Ferenc Huszar](https://www.inference.vc/about/) and [Sebastian Nowozin](http://www.nowozin.net/sebastian/). I'm generously funded by Microsoft through an [i-CASE fellowship](https://www.ukri.org/councils/epsrc/career-and-skills-development/studentships/industrial-case/).

I am interested in machine learning, specifically the science of deep learning, as well as what deep learning can enable in other fields, such as physics and mathematics.
