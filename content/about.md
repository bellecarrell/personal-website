Welcome web traveler! I'm a master's student at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/) in the [Center for Language and Speech Processing](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/) and the [Human Language Technology Center of Excellence (HLTCOE)](https://hltcoe.jhu.edu/). I am generously supported through a research assistantship by my advisor, [Ben Van Durme](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~vandurme/).

I am interested in machine learning and natural language processing.
